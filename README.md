# Coffee_Console_Mashine

More sophisticated version of previous project (chat-bot), a coffee machine simulator.

This console coffee machine implement basic principles of OOP. 

Also:
- it has a menu that asks user what to do and interprets his input depanding on the state of the coffee machine;
- the machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. 
You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money.
